# Hi v16!

I work as a C++ and Java software developer.

I have the educational background of Electronics and Telecommunications.
My specialization is [^1] Microprocessor Systems and Programmable Logic Devices (Assembler, C, C++, Verilog, VHDL).

During last year of my studies I had the opportunity to start working as a C++ software developer and in very interesting projects.

I started with programming of SCADA systems for Energy Distributing Systems in C++ (proprietary C++ framework, MFC).
Along the time I started programming Web Applications in the same domain (Java, Spring, JSF, Hibernate).

I enjoy my profession everyday [^2].

PS. Also developing my skills a little in the areas of Python and JS (React) after-hours.

[^1]: perheps "was" ;)
[^2]: fast everyday ;)
